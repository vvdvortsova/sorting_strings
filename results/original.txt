Be all my sins remember'd.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
When he himself might his quietus make
Than fly to others that we know not of?
But that the dread of something after death,
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
And thus the native hue of resolution
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
