A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And prologue to the omen coming on,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Unto our climatures and countrymen.—
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
