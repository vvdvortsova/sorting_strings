And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And thus the native hue of resolution
Be all my sins remember'd.
But that the dread of something after death,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Than fly to others that we know not of?
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The insolence of office and the spurns
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
