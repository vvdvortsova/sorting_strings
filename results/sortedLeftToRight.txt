Be all my sins remember'd.
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
When he himself might his quietus make
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
But that the dread of something after death,
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And thus the native hue of resolution
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The insolence of office and the spurns
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
