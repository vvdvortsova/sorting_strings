The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Unto our climatures and countrymen.—
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
As harbingers preceding still the fates
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
