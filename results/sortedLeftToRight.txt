Be all my sins remember'd.
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
But that the dread of something after death,
When he himself might his quietus make
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And enterprises of great pith and moment
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The insolence of office and the spurns
And thus the native hue of resolution
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
