A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, 
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: 
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. 
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead 
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands 
And prologue to the omen coming on, 
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
